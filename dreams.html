                        <p>I have always wanted to study the design of environmental art. I feel that if I like it, I give up, and I will regret it later. Therefore, I decided to study this major in the future. I want to study in England. This decision has been in my mind for a long time, but I never said it. I was afraid that people would laugh at me for not being good enough, and I was afraid of being rejected by my parents. But it was all up to me, so I told my parents about my idea. I thought I was going to be opposed, but I didn't think that my father and mother would support me very quickly.

                            <p>The cost of studying abroad in the UK is very high, which is not only expensive, but also preparing for ielts in the early stage, taking the ielts test and preparing the collection of works. Making money is not easy, and my parents are willing to pay for it. I really appreciate it. I am very happy in this family life, they meet any of my request, they gave all my love, and at the moment, under this decision, I can do is to study hard and conscientious learning English, steadfast to complete assignments, efforts to test. I must be worthy of their efforts, strive to achieve my own goals, and strive to be the proud people!

                        <p>Britain is a country I yearn for. Although I haven't been there yet, I have a certain understanding of it. I like the series of novels and movies of harry potter, I like the exquisite architectural style of England, I like fluent English, and I also like the excellent learning atmosphere of some universities in Britain. I want to travel around the world and I want to leave a period of my study there. World is big and I don't want to be a place to live, go out, maybe I will learn a whole new world, so I firmly my dream, I think as long as I would like to insist, have enough patience and good attitude to my studies, I must can do it, dreams can come true!
