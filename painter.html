                    <p>This is an American illustrator. She is not the world famous painter. She is not Van Gogh, nor is Monet more than Da Vinci. She is just an ordinary woman. She works in a government agency, but she has always loved painting, and she doesn't love her current job. She starts traveling around the world, picks up her brushes, and goes wherever she goes. She travels with a paintbrush while others travel with her camera. What is striking is that she USES only small iron boxes, which are novel, convenient and effective. When I first saw these works, I liked them. Art comes from living, and pursuing what you love should be the best thing.

                    <p>This is my work.
These black and white decorative paintings were part of my graphic design assignment during my freshman year. Through the line color block, order and disorder, the blend of each other makes a very good picture. Japanese artist kusama yayoi is one of the most famous wave point of art, it illustrates the simple can also bring good results, so I have been in this work to try and drew 50 in total, although the process is a little hard, but also through the process of doing homework give yourself a chance to practice and thinking seriously, meaning a lot.
